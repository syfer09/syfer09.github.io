# Notes

This is a collection of my personal notes about everything pentesting/cybersecurity. Taken from a variety of sources.

## Shell
Program that takes input from user and passes commands off to the system.

## Port

Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. 

Common ports

| Port | Type | Common services|
|------|------|----------------|
20/21 | TCP | FTP
22|TCP|SSH
23|TCP|Telnet
25|TCP|SMPT
80|TCP|HTTP
88|TCP|Kerberos
139|TCP|SMB
161|TCP/UDP|SNMP
389|TCP/UDP|LDAP(Active Directory)
443|TCP|SSL/TLS(HTTP)
445|TCP|SMB
3389|TCP|Microsoft RDP

- [WEB](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/)
- [nmap specific](https://nullsec.us/top-1-000-tcp-and-udp-ports-nmap-default/)

## Web Servers

Application that runs in the back end which handles http(s) traffic from client side browsers

### Owasp Top 10
|No.|Name|Description|Example|
---|----|------------|-------
1|Broken Access Control| Restrictions not properly implemented to prevent users from accessing other users
2|Cryptographic Failures| Borked encryption
3|Injection|Lack of parsing user input leads to commands being injected|SQLi LDAPi
4|Insecure design|Not designed with security in mind
5|Security Misconfiguration|Insecure default configurations for security tools|Detailed error messages
6|Vulnerable and Outdated Components|Not updating, or using vulnerable components
7|Identification and Authentification failure|Authentication and session management misconfigurations|Stealing session tokens
8|Software and data integrity failures|Code and infrastructure which does not protect against integrity violations|Plugins,libraries and modules from 3rd party sources which may not be secure
9|Security Logging and Monitoring Failures|Need to be able to detect, escalate and respond to active breaches|Log monitoring, message signing
10|Server side request forgery|Web applications that fetch remote resources without validating the user URL

## SSH

## Netcat
Network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP Ports. 

[Windows binary](https://nmap.org/download.html)

Connect to an open port: `nc 10.10.10.10 22`
> add `-nv` flag to grab banner

### [PowerCat](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat)
Windows alternative

### Socat

Several features that nc does not support such as port forwarding and serial connections.

[Upgrading socat shell to TTY](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/#method-2-using-socat)

[Standalone Binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries)

## Tmux
Terminal multiplexer which can create multiple windows from a single terminal session.
> See also: Screen

- Default prefix to open a new window `CTRL+B`
- Hit prefix and number for a specific window
- `SHIFT + %` for a vertical split, `SHIFT + "` for horizontal

## NMAP

Swiss army knife of network mapping

Banner Grabbing: `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>`

#### NMAP SMB scripts
Script|Description
-|-
smb-os-discovery.nse|interact with SMB service to report operating system version


## SMB

Windows service for sharing resources across networks

### smbclient

Interacts and enumerates smb shares.
- `-L` flag lists shares
- `-N` flag suppresses the password prompt
- `-U` specifies user

To enumerate: `smbclient -N -L \\\\10.10.10.10`

To connect: `smbclient \\\\10.10.10.10\\sharename`


## SNMP
Provide information and statistics about a router or device.

>In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string. Encryption and authentication was only added in SNMP version 3.
